To perform gradient descent directly on this function, you need to find the partial derivatives of $f(x, y)$ in terms of both $x$ and $y$. To be clear, there is no cost function to plug in here, we are using the derivative of the Himmelblau function directly as our cost function or **objective function** and minimizing it!\n",
